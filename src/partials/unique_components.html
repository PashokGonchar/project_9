                        containing cocoa, sugar and milk. It is the most consumed type of
                        chocolate. Chocolate was originally sold and consumed as a beverage in pre-Columbian times.
                        Although
                        four-fifths of all
                        milk chocolate is sold in the United States and Europe, increasingly large amounts are consumed
                        in
                        China and Latin
                        America.

                        Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source
                        of
                        nutrition for young
                        mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they are able to digest solid
                        food.Early-lactation milk, which is
                        called colostrum, contains antibodies that strengthen the immune system, and thus reduces the
                        risk
                        of many diseases.
                        Milk contains many nutrients, including protein and lactose.

                        Almonds, pistachios, and walnuts are some types of nuts that contain healthy nutrients. When

                        Semi-sweet chocolate has a cocoa solid content of 35 to 65%. One of the best ways to gain an
                        understanding of this type
                        of chocolate is to compare it to a different type of chocolate. Semisweet is darker than milk
                        chocolate. In a taste
                        comparison, it has a slightly bitter taste whereas milk chocolate is sweeter and more mellow.
                        This
                        delectable flavor of
                        chocolate is very versatile.
